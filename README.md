üçï Pizza Sales Dashboard ‚Äì SQL & Power BI üìä

Overview

This project is a dynamic pizza sales dashboard created using SQL and Power BI. The goal is to analyze sales performance, identify trends, and provide actionable insights to help a pizza restaurant optimize its operations.


Project Components
1. Data Acquisition
The project begins with the acquisition of raw sales data. This data may include information such as customer orders, product details, order dates, and transaction amounts. Data can be obtained from various sources, including databases, CSV files, or other data storage systems.

2. Data Transformation with SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to clean, filter, and transform the raw data into a format suitable for analysis. This may involve tasks such as joining tables, aggregating data, handling missing values, and creating new calculated fields.

3. Data Analysis
Once the data is prepared, various SQL queries are written to perform in-depth data analysis. This may include:

Identifying top-selling pizza flavors.
Analyzing sales trends over time.
Evaluating customer demographics and preferences.
Calculating average order values.
Assessing the performance of individual restaurant locations.

4. Power BI Visualization
Power BI is used to create interactive and informative visualizations that showcase the insights gained from the data analysis. The visualizations may include:

Bar charts and pie charts displaying sales by product category.
Time series charts illustrating sales trends.
Geographic maps showing the distribution of restaurant locations.
Dashboards summarizing key performance indicators (KPIs).

5. Insights and Recommendations

Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided :

Store credit or points can be applied as discounts when purchasing pizzas. Additionally, by occasionally multiplying these points on random days, sales may experience an uplift.

To enhance Sunday revenue, think about reducing working hours to support employee well-being while also driving pizza sales through limited-time B1G1 flash sales.

Let customers design custom pizzas with up to 5 toppings. The best ones chosen by the top chef can be added to the menu, and the customer who created it can name the pizza, allowing for regular menu updates based on customer choices.

At the close of the year, gather feedback from customers to identify areas for improvement in the restaurant.

Due to the lower demand for XL and XXL-sized pizzas, consider introducing a half-and-half pizza option, allowing customers to enjoy two different pizza varieties on a single pie.
